# momiji

A basic Motorola 68000 emulator. This is not production-ready and I will only ever implement a subset of the assembler.

There is not GUI right now; one will be implemented on top of [tewi](https://github.com/andry-dev/tewi).

## Dependencies

CMake and any C++17 conforming compiler.


## As a library

Include `"Parser.h"`or `"Emulator.h"` and use the relevant functions.
